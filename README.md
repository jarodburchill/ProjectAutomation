## Requirements:
- Python 3.6+
- Git
- npm
- A text editor (i.e. VS Code, Atom, etc.)
## Installation:
### Windows:
Clone the repository:
```
cd C:\
git clone https://github.com/jarodburchill/ProjectAutomation
```
Set the environment variable:
```
setx path "%path%;C:\ProjectAutomation\windows"
```
### Mac/Linux:
Clone the repository:
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/jarodburchill/ProjectAutomation
```
Set the environment variable:
```
PATH=$PATH:~/ProjectAutomation/mac-linux
```
Make executable:
```
cd ~/ProjectAutomation/mac-linux
chmod +x new-project
```
## Configuration:
All configuration options can be found in the `script.config` file.
### Options and Defaults:
The `localPath` option takes a file path string to determine where new local repositories will be created.  
  
Default path for Windows users, change as required:
```
localPath = C:/Projects/
```
Linux users must change the local path:
```
localPath = /home/$USER/Projects/
```
Mac users must change the local path:
```
localPath = /Users/$USER/Projects/
```
#### $USER = your machine's username. YOU MUST CHANGE THIS!  
-----------------------------
The `editor` option takes a string to determine what editor new projects will be opened in after creation.
```
editor = <editor>
```
Any editor that is installed on your local machine is supported (provided it has a command line command to open). Set to `none` if you don't wish to open the repo in an editor.
#### See EDITORS.md for a list of editors.
-----------------------------
The `username` option is blank by default. If a correct GitHub username is entered into this option, the script will not prompt you to enter a username on each run.  
```
username = <username>
```
-----------------------------
The `password` option is blank by default. If a correct GitHub password is entered into this option and the username option has also been provided, the script will not prompt you to enter a password on each run.  
```
password = <password>
```
-----------------------------
#### NOTE: WIP; [see issue #29.](https://github.com/jarodburchill/ProjectAutomation/issues/29)
The `twoFacAuth` option is set to `false` by default. Set to `true` if your account uses 2 factor authentication.
```
twoFacAuth = <true/false>
```
