# Editor help
This is a list of editors and what string to use in `script.config` for them. 

#### NOTE: IF USING ATOM, GO INTO IT, SELECT "ATOM" AND SELECT "INSTALL SCRIPT COMMANDS" BEFORE RUNNING THE SCRIPT!

Any editor, so long as it has a terminal command to open it, will work with this. If you don't want your new project to open in an editor, set the string to `"none"`. By default, it is set to open VSCode

```
Visual Studio Code (aka VSCode): "code"
Atom: "atom"
Vim: "vim"
Emacs: "emacs"
```

Please add to this list!
