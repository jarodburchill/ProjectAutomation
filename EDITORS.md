# Editor Help
This is a list of editors and what string to use in `script.config` for them. 
#### NOTE: IF USING ATOM, GO INTO IT, SELECT "ATOM" AND SELECT "INSTALL SCRIPT COMMANDS" BEFORE RUNNING THE SCRIPT!
Any editor, so long as it has a terminal command to open it, will work with this. If you don't want your new project to open in an editor, set the string to `"none"`. By default, it is set to open VSCode.
```
Visual Studio Code (aka VSCode): "code" (use "code-insiders" if you use VSCode Insiders)
Visual Source Codium (aka VSCodium): "codium"
Atom: "atom" (use "atom-beta"/"atom-nightly if you use Atom Beta/Nightly)
Vim: "vim"
Emacs: "emacs"
```
Please help by adding editors to this list!
